# Important
    - need to pass the jwt token when accessing protected route.
    - Hide password and sensitive info from config.js
    - Do we need to use concurrency at all?
    - Migrate javascript to typescript?

# Fixed issues
    - Router parameter in the homeroute should only match integers, but its matching everything. (FIXED)
